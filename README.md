Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure you have a few things ready. This guide walks you through setting up your development environment, connecting to a local or remote database, and starting the frontend and backend services. The aim is to have you up and running quickly so you can explore the features, contribute to the project, and customize the platform for your own events.

Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (or yarn) for frontend tooling and local services.
- PostgreSQL database (local or remote) for data storage. Supabase can be used as an alternative backend for some deployments.
- Docker (optional) for running services like PostgreSQL in containers during development.
- Basic familiarity with React and TypeScript.
- A code editor, such as VS Code, installed and configured for TypeScript.

Environment Overview
- Frontend: A React + TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Backend/Data: PostgreSQL with Supabase services for Auth and Realtime where applicable.
- Authentication: JWT-based tokens for user sessions and role-based permissions.
- State Management: Local component state and a UI-friendly data fetch layer to keep your UI snappy and predictable.
- Deployment: Docker-Compose, Kubernetes-ready configuration, or cloud platform deployment depending on your stack preference.

Local Development Setup
This section walks you through creating a local development environment. It assumes you want to run both the frontend and backend locally while using a local Postgres database. If you prefer to use Supabase in a hosted mode, you can adapt the environment accordingly.

1) Install dependencies
- Install Node.js (version that aligns with the TypeScript setup in the project).
- Install yarn or npm to manage packages.
- Install Docker if you plan to run Postgres in a container locally.

2) Install and configure the frontend
- Clone the repository.
- Install frontend dependencies with yarn install or npm install.
- Create a .env.local file with the required environment variables for API endpoints, authentication, and any feature flags you want to enable or disable.
- Start the frontend with yarn start or npm start.

3) Install and configure the backend
- If the project includes a local backend, install the necessary dependencies.
- Create a .env file with database connection details, JWT secret keys, and other configuration.
- Run database migrations to initialize the schema.
- Start the backend server.

4) Database setup
- If you use a local Postgres instance, ensure the database is created and accessible with the configured credentials.
- If you use Docker, you can start a Postgres container and expose the necessary port.

5) Run and verify
- Run both frontend and backend services.
- Open your browser to the local URL.
- Confirm you can log in, view the event dashboard, and navigate through different roles and pages.

6) Debugging and logs
- Check the console for frontend messages.
- Look at backend logs for API errors or authentication issues.
- If you run into issues with reactivity, verify that the Supabase or alternative real-time service is properly configured.

Supabase Setup and Secrets
- Supabase provides a ready-to-use backend with Postgres, Auth, Realtime, and Storage. It’s a robust option for a quick-start setup and for production-grade deployments.
- For a local development environment, you can run a local Postgres instance and a local instance of Supabase tools if you want end-to-end parity with hosted setups.
- Ensure you keep secrets secure. Use environment variables for all sensitive data, such as JWT signing keys, database URLs, and API keys.
- When switching between environments (development, staging, production), maintain separate configurations to avoid cross-environment data leakage and to prevent accidental data loss.

Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-Based Access: The system uses JSON Web Tokens to authenticate users. Tokens carry claims about user identity and roles. These claims drive access control in the frontend and backend.
- Role-Based Access Control: Roles include Organizer, Speaker, Attendee, Admin, and potentially Guest. Each role has a defined set of permissions. The UI shows or hides features accordingly.
- Token Renewal: Tokens are refreshed securely, with appropriate controls to prevent token reuse. Short expiration windows reduce risk while providing a smooth user experience.
- Secure Storage: Tokens are stored securely in memory and, if stored in the browser, protected with best practices such as HttpOnly cookies where feasible or secure local storage with appropriate protections.

Frontend Design System and UX
- Tailwind CSS: The design system uses Tailwind for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI assembly and consistent theming.
- Component Library: A curated set of reusable components for forms, modals, tables, dashboards, and interactive widgets. Components are accessible and keyboard-friendly.
- Accessibility: The interface is designed to be accessible. Color contrast, focus states, and aria-labels are implemented to assist users with different needs.
- Internationalization: The UI is structured to support multiple languages. Text content is centralized for easy translation.
- Responsiveness: The layout adapts to different screen sizes. Desktop dashboards yield a comprehensive overview, while mobile views remain functional for quick tasks.

Deployment Strategies
- Local Development: Use Docker Compose to run PostgreSQL and any necessary services. The frontend runs via a local dev server.
- Staging: Deploy a staging environment that mirrors production for testing and validation before release.
- Production: A production deployment may use a cloud provider with managed Postgres instances and a scalable frontend hosting solution.
- Data Isolation: Each event’s data stays isolated so multiple events can run in the same instance safely.
- Backups and Recovery: Regular backups of the database and assets. A recovery plan helps you recover quickly from data loss.

Testing and Quality Assurance
- Unit Tests: Focus on core business logic and data handling. Mock APIs and services to isolate components.
- Integration Tests: Validate the interaction between frontend and backend services, including authentication flows.
- End-to-End Tests: Simulate user journeys, such as registering for an event, creating a session, and running a live poll.
